# üèóÔ∏è OS Construction Model

This project simulates the construction of a **10-story apartment building**, where each floor and apartment represents **processes and threads** in an operating system. It's built using **C language**, utilizing **POSIX processes**, **threads**, and **semaphores** to demonstrate **synchronization**, **parallelism**, and **resource management**.

## üìå Project Description

Each floor is simulated as a **separate process**, while each apartment on a floor is a **thread**. Daire (apartment) threads execute a set of construction tasks with synchronization rules:

- **Thread (Apartment)** tasks:
  - Plumbing (limited to 3 simultaneous jobs)
  - Plastering
  - Painting
  - Crane use (limited to 2 simultaneous)
  - Scaffold use (limited to 2 simultaneous)
  - Cleaning (spawned as a nested thread)

- **Process (Floor)** rules:
  - Floor *n+1* cannot start before *n* is completed (uses `wait()`).
  - All apartments must finish before a floor is marked completed.

| Concept                 | Implementation                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Multi-processing        | Each floor is launched as a child process via `fork()` |
| Multi-threading         | Each apartment is a thread using `pthread_create()`    |
| Synchronization         | Shared semaphores: `vinc`, `usta`, `iskele`            |
| Resource limitation     | Max 3 plumbers, 2 cranes, 2 scaffolders                |
| Process coordination    | `wait()` ensures floors are built sequentially         |
| Race condition handling | Protected access to shared resources                   |
| Nested threads          | Cleaning step is handled in a separate thread          |
